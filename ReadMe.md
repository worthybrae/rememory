## Introduction

Rememory is a project focused on generating 3D visual designs. The project uses Python and leverages the power of the Pygame library to create intricate visual patterns and designs. Whether you're looking for rotating cubes, abstract patterns, or any form of digital art, Rememory has a module for it.

pip install -r requirements.txt  # Assuming you have a requirements file.
```

### Running the Project

From the root directory, run:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Features

- **Dynamic 3D Designs**: Experience vibrant and evolving 3D designs that captivate the viewer.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily add new art modules in the `generation` directory to expand the visual possibilities.
- **Customizable**: Tweak parameters, combine modules, or add your own to create unique visuals.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a design or pattern in mind, feel free to add a new module under the `generation` directory and submit a pull request.
